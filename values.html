<p>The following values are at the core of our work and each of our components</p>
<h2 id="naturalness">Naturalness</h2>
<p>We want to learn from the success in nature and make interactions as natural and enjoyable as possible.</p>
<h2 id="openness">Openness</h2>
<p>Instead of hiding in a walled garden, we keep our minds and doors open.</p>
<p>Our technology is open source and we share our knowledge to build systems that are more than the sum of their parts.</p>
<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>
<p>You have your own mission and your own goals. We help you accomplish those by staying out of your focus.</p>
<h2 id="subtlety">Subtlety</h2>
<p>Where other ecosystems try to enfeeble or patronise you, YouZen strives to empower you.</p>
<p>YouZen will not get in your way - your data is yours and our mission is to help you grow.</p>
