<p>The following values are at the core of our work and each of our components.<br>Everything we do, everything we build and everything we strive for is representing these values.</p>
<h2 id="-strong-naturalness-strong-"><strong>Naturalness</strong></h2>
<p>We want to learn from the success in nature and make interactions as natural and enjoyable as possible.</p>
<h2 id="-strong-openness-strong-"><strong>Openness</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of hiding in a walled garden, we keep our minds and doors open.</p>
<p>Our technology is open source and we share our knowledge to build systems that are more than the sum of their parts.</p>
<h2 id="-strong-simplicity-strong-"><strong>Simplicity</strong></h2>
<p>You have your own mission and your own goals. We help you accomplish those by staying out of your focus.</p>
<h2 id="-strong-subtlety-strong-"><strong>Subtlety</strong></h2>
<p>Where other ecosystems try to enfeeble or patronise you, ZenCube strives to empower you.</p>
<p>ZenCube will not get in your way - your data is yours and our mission is to help you grow.</p>
