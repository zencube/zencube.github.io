# Values
The following values are at the core of our work and each of our components.
Everything we do, everything we build and everything we strive for is representing these values.

## <strong>Simplicity</strong>
You have your own mission and your own goals. We help you accomplish those by staying out of your focus.

## <strong>Subtlety</strong>
Where other ecosystems try to enfeeble or patronise you, ZenCube strives to empower you.

ZenCube will not get in your way - your data is yours and our mission is to help you grow.

## <strong>Beauty</strong>
We want to learn from the success in nature and make interactions as natural and enjoyable as possible.

For this we want to provide a beautiful experience for your everyday tasks.

## <strong>Openness</strong>
Instead of hiding in a walled garden, we keep our minds and doors open.

Our technology is open source and we share our knowledge to build systems that are more than the sum of their parts.
